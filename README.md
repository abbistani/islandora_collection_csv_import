# Islandora Collection CSV Import 

## Introduction

This module is for adding collection objects to Islandora using a .csv file. 

## Requirements

This module requires the following modules/libraries:
* [Islandora](https://github.com/islandora/islandora)
* [Islandora Basic Collection](https://github.com/Islandora/islandora_solution_pack_collection)

## Installation

Install as usual, see [this](https://drupal.org/documentation/install/modules-themes/modules-7) for further information.

## Configuration

CSV's must be properly prepared.  Any comma within a field (i.e. the LABEL field) must be replaced with
a double pipe ie - 'Nursing, Department of' must be replaced with
'Nursing|| Department of'

Do not use commas in the PID or PARENT fields.

If multiple arguments are supplied for the PARENT field, they must be
separated with a ~  ie islandora:root~islandora:basic_image_collection.

The CSV must contain the following columns:

* LABEL
* PID
* PARENT

Where LABEL is the label of the collection object to import, PID is a valid PID for this collection object (or a namespace,
in which case the PID will be assigned automatically), and PARENT is a list of pids (separated by ~) to which this collection
will have an isMemberOfCollection relationship.

The CSV can also contain a COLLECTION_POLICY COLUMN with the complete path to a valid COLLECTION_POLICY XML file for the
collection object.  If you choose not to add a COLLECTION_POLICY, you won't be able to add to the collections using the GUI
(though you can add to them programmatically).
